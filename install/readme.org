* mtheme

good looking beamer theme: https://github.com/matze/mtheme

Install via

git clone https://github.com/matze/mtheme
cd mtheme
make sty
make install
texhash

then use \usetheme{metropolis}


Install 'firasans' font for the theme to look extra slick (for now)
[https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/fira-sans]

To make use of this font, we need to use the 'xelatex' command, not
'pdflatex'. This command is in the slides/org-files-to-pdf.el file,
and can be changed to `pdflatex` if xelatex is not available.

See
http://mirror.ox.ac.uk/sites/ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/beamer-contrib/themes/metropolis/doc/metropolistheme.pdf
for details.


* Emacs


To make the scripts in 'slides' work, it is best (on OS X) to install
emacs via brew, either

   brew install emacs

or

   brew install emacs --with-cocoa

to get the GUI version.


Tested with Emacs 25.4, May 2016
